# aurora-theme README

## About

  This theme is based on Ray-x's Aurora color scheme for Neovim with Treesitter, so credit goes to them.  Since C is the language used for my job, it is the only one supported. Some minor testing was done on HTML, JavaScript, and C++, but use at your own peril.

  Feel free to fork it and make it your own.

  I think it looks better with the Hack font or Fira Code.
