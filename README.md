# aurora-theme README

## About

  This theme is based on Ray-x's Aurora color scheme for Neovim with Treesitter, so credit goes to them.
  Since C is the language used for my job, that is the only languaged supported. Some minor testing was
  done on HTML, JavaScript, and C++, but use at your own risk.

  Feel free to fork it and make it your own.
